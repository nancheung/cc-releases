# Release 1.0.45

- Redesigned Search (Grep) tool with new tool input parameters and features
- Disabled IDE diffs for notebook files, fixing "Timeout waiting after 1000ms" error
- Fixed config file corruption issue by enforcing atomic writes
- Updated prompt input undo to Ctrl+\_ to avoid breaking existing Ctrl+U behavior, matching zsh's undo shortcut
- Stop Hooks: Fixed transcript path after /clear and fixed triggering when loop ends with tool call
- Custom slash commands: Restored namespacing in command names based on subdirectories. For example, .claude/commands/frontend/component.md is now /frontend:component, not /component.
