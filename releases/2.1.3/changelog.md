# Release 2.1.3

- Merged slash commands and skills, simplifying the mental model with no change in behavior
- Added release channel (`stable` or `latest`) toggle to `/config`
- Added detection and warnings for unreachable permission rules, with warnings in `/doctor` and after saving rules that include the source of each rule and actionable fix guidance
- Fixed plan files persisting across `/clear` commands, now ensuring a fresh plan file is used after clearing a conversation
- Fixed false skill duplicate detection on filesystems with large inodes (e.g., ExFAT) by using 64-bit precision for inode values
- Fixed mismatch between background task count in status bar and items shown in tasks dialog
- Fixed sub-agents using the wrong model during conversation compaction
- Fixed web search in sub-agents using incorrect model
- Fixed trust dialog acceptance when running from the home directory not enabling trust-requiring features like hooks during the session
- Improved terminal rendering stability by preventing uncontrolled writes from corrupting cursor state
- Improved slash command suggestion readability by truncating long descriptions to 2 lines
- Changed tool hook execution timeout from 60 seconds to 10 minutes
- [VSCode] Added clickable destination selector for permission requests, allowing you to choose where settings are saved (this project, all projects, shared with team, or session only)
