# Release 2.1.45

- Added support for Claude Sonnet 4.6
- Added support for reading `enabledPlugins` and `extraKnownMarketplaces` from `--add-dir` directories
- Added `spinnerTipsOverride` setting to customize spinner tips — configure `tips` with an array of custom tip strings, and optionally set `excludeDefault: true` to show only your custom tips instead of the built-in ones
- Added `SDKRateLimitInfo` and `SDKRateLimitEvent` types to the SDK, enabling consumers to receive rate limit status updates including utilization, reset times, and overage information
- Fixed Agent Teams teammates failing on Bedrock, Vertex, and Foundry by propagating API provider environment variables to tmux-spawned processes (anthropics/claude-code#23561)
- Fixed sandbox "operation not permitted" errors when writing temporary files on macOS by using the correct per-user temp directory (anthropics/claude-code#21654)
- Fixed Task tool (backgrounded agents) crashing with a `ReferenceError` on completion (anthropics/claude-code#22087)
- Fixed autocomplete suggestions not being accepted on Enter when images are pasted in the input
- Fixed skills invoked by subagents incorrectly appearing in main session context after compaction
- Fixed excessive `.claude.json.backup` files accumulating on every startup
- Fixed plugin-provided commands, agents, and hooks not being available immediately after installation without requiring a restart
- Improved startup performance by removing eager loading of session history for stats caching
- Improved memory usage for shell commands that produce large output — RSS no longer grows unboundedly with command output size
- Improved collapsed read/search groups to show the current file or search pattern being processed beneath the summary line while active
- [VSCode] Improved permission destination choice (project/user/session) to persist across sessions
