# Release 2.1.31

- Added session resume hint on exit, showing how to continue your conversation later
- Added support for full-width (zenkaku) space input from Japanese IME in checkbox selection
- Fixed PDF too large errors permanently locking up sessions, requiring users to start a new conversation
- Fixed bash commands incorrectly reporting failure with "Read-only file system" errors when sandbox mode was enabled
- Fixed a crash that made sessions unusable after entering plan mode when project config in `~/.claude.json` was missing default fields
- Fixed `temperatureOverride` being silently ignored in the streaming API path, causing all streaming requests to use the default temperature (1) regardless of the configured override
- Fixed LSP shutdown/exit compatibility with strict language servers that reject null params
- Improved system prompts to more clearly guide the model toward using dedicated tools (Read, Edit, Glob, Grep) instead of bash equivalents (`cat`, `sed`, `grep`, `find`), reducing unnecessary bash command usage
- Improved PDF and request size error messages to show actual limits (100 pages, 20MB)
- Reduced layout jitter in the terminal when the spinner appears and disappears during streaming
- Removed misleading Anthropic API pricing from model selector for third-party provider (Bedrock, Vertex, Foundry) users
