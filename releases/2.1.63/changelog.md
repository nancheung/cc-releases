# Release 2.1.63

- Added `/simplify` and `/batch` bundled slash commands
- Fixed local slash command output like /cost appearing as user-sent messages instead of system messages in the UI
- Project configs & auto memory now shared across git worktrees of the same repository
- Added `ENABLE_CLAUDEAI_MCP_SERVERS=false` env var to opt out from making claude.ai MCP servers available
- Improved `/model` command to show the currently active model in the slash command menu
- Added HTTP hooks, which can POST JSON to a URL and receive JSON instead of running a shell command
- Fixed listener leak in bridge polling loop
- Fixed listener leak in MCP OAuth flow cleanup
- Added manual URL paste fallback during MCP OAuth authentication. If the automatic localhost redirect doesn't work, you can paste the callback URL to complete authentication.
- Fixed memory leak when navigating hooks configuration menu
- Fixed listener leak in interactive permission handler during auto-approvals
- Fixed file count cache ignoring glob ignore patterns
- Fixed memory leak in bash command prefix cache
- Fixed MCP tool/resource cache leak on server reconnect
- Fixed IDE host IP detection cache incorrectly sharing results across ports
- Fixed WebSocket listener leak on transport reconnect
- Fixed memory leak in git root detection cache that could cause unbounded growth in long-running sessions
- Fixed memory leak in JSON parsing cache that grew unbounded over long sessions
- VSCode: Fixed remote sessions not appearing in conversation history
- Fixed a race condition in the REPL bridge where new messages could arrive at the server interleaved with historical messages during the initial connection flush, causing message ordering issues.
- Fixed memory leak where long-running teammates retained all messages in AppState even after conversation compaction
- Fixed a memory leak where MCP server fetch caches were not cleared on disconnect, causing growing memory usage with servers that reconnect frequently
- Improved memory usage in long sessions with subagents by stripping heavy progress message payloads during context compaction
- Added "Always copy full response" option to the `/copy` picker. When selected, future `/copy` commands will skip the code block picker and copy the full response directly.
- VSCode: Added session rename and remove actions to the sessions list
- Fixed `/clear` not resetting cached skills, which could cause stale skill content to persist in the new conversation
