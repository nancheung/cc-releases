# Release 2.1.59

- Claude automatically saves useful context to auto-memory. Manage with /memory
- Added `/copy` command to show an interactive picker when code blocks are present, allowing selection of individual code blocks or the full response.
- Improved "always allow" prefix suggestions for compound bash commands (e.g. `cd /tmp && git fetch && git push`) to compute smarter per-subcommand prefixes instead of treating the whole command as one
- Improved ordering of short task lists
- Improved memory usage in multi-agent sessions by releasing completed subagent task state
- Fixed MCP OAuth token refresh race condition when running multiple Claude Code instances simultaneously
- Fixed shell commands not showing a clear error message when the working directory has been deleted
- Fixed config file corruption that could wipe authentication when multiple Claude Code instances ran simultaneously
