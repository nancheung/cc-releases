# Release 2.1.14

- Added history-based autocomplete in bash mode (`!`) - type a partial command and press Tab to complete from your bash command history
- Added search to installed plugins list - type to filter by name or description
- Added support for pinning plugins to specific git commit SHAs, allowing marketplace entries to install exact versions
- Fixed a regression where the context window blocking limit was calculated too aggressively, blocking users at ~65% context usage instead of the intended ~98%
- Fixed memory issues that could cause crashes when running parallel subagents
- Fixed memory leak in long-running sessions where stream resources were not cleaned up after shell commands completed
- Fixed `@` symbol incorrectly triggering file autocomplete suggestions in bash mode
- Fixed `@`-mention menu folder click behavior to navigate into directories instead of selecting them
- Fixed `/feedback` command generating invalid GitHub issue URLs when description is very long
- Fixed `/context` command to show the same token count and percentage as the status line in verbose mode
- Fixed an issue where `/config`, `/context`, `/model`, and `/todos` command overlays could close unexpectedly
- Fixed slash command autocomplete selecting wrong command when typing similar commands (e.g., `/context` vs `/compact`)
- Fixed inconsistent back navigation in plugin marketplace when only one marketplace is configured
- Fixed iTerm2 progress bar not clearing properly on exit, preventing lingering indicators and bell sounds
- Improved backspace to delete pasted text as a single token instead of one character at a time
- [VSCode] Added `/usage` command to display current plan usage
